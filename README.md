# School_District_Analysis
During this project, we were tasked with analyzing a dataset of information based on the characteristics and averages of 2 groups of schools : charter and public. The analysis considered the level of budget for each classification of schools but it would be good to conduct an analysis of the same grade across each school type and within each school type. For instance how does grade 12 from charter school compares with grade 12 in public school. How does grade 12 in one school compare with grade 12 in another school. Finally, is budget the main driver in the performance of schools? Why does it appear that students performed better in reading than math? 

Finally, an important fact that we could gather at the end of this analysis was that the average school budget, of public and charter schools, was 911195.558251 and 872625.656236, respectively, meaning in this case public schools have more budget than charter ones and this not standard, unless charter schools in this case are merely a subset of public schools but not real private schools with adequante funding.
